Welcome on this blog where I'll mainly write about my programming experiments and share thoughts. :)

I'm a web developer so I'm used to work with javascript, but I also write a lot of code in java.
A few months ago, I had the opportunity to briefly test ruby on rails and find it particularly fascinating.
Everything seems very easy, smooth and well designed, so I've become pretty curious about all this ruby world.
There are so many people that are actually using these technologies, I can't ignore them anymore!
This is why I want to start this blog with an experiment: studying more deeply ruby and ruby on rails.

I'll start with ruby, because I believe this is important to understand the basis before digging.
[Try ruby][try-ruby] is a very good (free) resource to start.
And I've read that many people considered [Eloquent ruby, by Russ Olsen][eloquent-ruby] as a very valuable book to study ruby.
So I'll start with them and will report here my feelings about this language, and my point of view as a java developer.
